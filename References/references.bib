@article{1751-8121-50-5-055002,
	Abstract = {We compare the time evolution of entanglement measures after local operator excitation in the critical Ising model with predictions from conformal field theory. For the spin operator and its descendants we find that R{\'e}nyi entropies of a block of spins increase by a constant that matches the logarithm of the quantum dimension of the conformal family. However, for the energy operator we find a small constant contribution that differs from the conformal field theory answer equal to zero. We argue that the mismatch is caused by the subtleties in the identification between the local operators in conformal field theory and their lattice counterpart. Our results indicate that evolution of entanglement measures in locally excited states not only constraints this identification, but also can be used to extract non-trivial data about the conformal field theory that governs the critical point. We generalize our analysis to the Ising model away from the critical point, states with multiple local excitations, as well as the evolution of the relative entropy after local operator excitation and discuss universal features that emerge from numerics.},

	Abstract = {We construct a contour function for the entanglement entropies in generic harmonic lattices. In one spatial dimension, numerical analysis are performed by considering harmonic chains with either periodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the massless regime and for some configurations where the subsystem is a single interval, the numerical results for the contour function are compared to the inverse of the local weight function which multiplies the energy-momentum tensor in the corresponding entanglement hamiltonian, found through conformal field theory methods, and a good agreement is observed. A numerical analysis of the contour function for the entanglement entropy is performed also in a massless harmonic chain for a subsystem made by two disjoint intervals.},

	Abstract = {In one dimension, the area law and its implications for the approximability by matrix product states are the key to efficient numerical simulations involving quantum states. Similarly, in simulations involving quantum operators, the approximability by matrix product operators (in Hilbert--Schmidt norm) is tied to an operator area law , namely the fact that the operator space entanglement entropy (OSEE)---the natural analog of entanglement entropy for operators, investigated by Zanardi (2001 Phys. Rev . A 63 040304) and by Prosen and Pi{\v z}orn (2007 Phys. Rev. A 76 032316)---is bounded. In the present paper, it is shown that the OSEE can be calculated in two-dimensional conformal field theory, in a number of situations that are relevant to questions of simulability of long-time dynamics in one spatial dimension. It is argued that: (i) thermal density matrices ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/50/23/234001/aaa6f38ieqn001.gif] {$\rho \propto {\rm e}^{-\beta H}$} and generalized Gibbs ensemble density matrices ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/50/23/234001/aaa6f38ieqn002.gif] {$\rho \propto {\rm e}^{- H_{\rm GGE}}$} with local H GGE generically obey the operator area law; (ii) after a global quench, the OSEE first grows linearly with time, then decreases back to its thermal or GGE saturation value, implying that, while the operator area law is satisfied both in the initial state and in the asymptotic stationary state at large time, it is strongly violated in the transient regime; (iii) the OSEE of the evolution operator ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/50/23/234001/aaa6f38ieqn003.gif] {$U(t) = {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} H t}$} increases linearly with t , unless the Hamiltonian is in a localized phase; (iv) local operators in Heisenberg picture, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/50/23/234001/aaa6f38ieqn004.gif] {$\phi(t) = {\rm e}^{{\rm i} H t} \phi {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} H t}$} , have an OSEE that grows sublinearly in time (perhaps logarithmically), however it is unclear whether this effect can be captured in a traditional CFT framework, as the free fermion case hints at an unexpected breakdown of conformal invariance.},

We exploit this result in the XXZ spin chain, for which the entanglement spectrum is known by means of the corner transfer matrix. We find that the negativity spectrum levels are equally spaced, the spacing being half that in the entanglement spectrum. Moreover, the degeneracy of the spectrum is described by elegant combinatorial formulas, which are related to the counting of integer partitions. We also derive the asymptotic distribution of the negativity spectrum. We provide exact results for the logarithmic negativity and for the moments of the partial transpose.

	Abstract = {The rainbow chain is an inhomogenous exactly solvable local spin model that, in its ground state, displays a half-chain entanglement entropy growing linearly with the system size. Although many exact results about the rainbow chain are known, the structure of the underlying quantum field theory has not yet been unraveled. Here we show that the universal scaling features of this model are captured by a massless Dirac fermion in a curved space-time with constant negative curvature R ââ=âââ h 2 ( h is the amplitude of the inhomogeneity). This identification allows us to use recently developed techniques to study inhomogeneous conformal systems and to analytically characterise the entanglement entropies of more general bipartitions. These results are carefully tested against exact numerical calculations. Finally, we study the entanglement entropies of the rainbow chain in thermal states, and find that there is a non-trivial interplay between the rainbow effective temperature T R and the physical temperature T .},

At leading order for large domains, the logarithmic negativity and the logarithm of the ratio between the generic moment of the partial transpose and the moment of the reduced density matrix at the same order satisfy an area law in terms of the length of the curve shared by the adjacent regions. We give numerical evidence that the coefficient of the area law term in these quantities is related to the coefficient of the area law term in the R{\'e}nyi entropies. Whenever the curve shared by the adjacent domains contains vertices, a subleading logarithmic term occurs in these quantities and the numerical values of the corner function for some pairs of angles are obtained.

	Abstract = {Computing entanglement entropy and its cousins is often challenging even in the simplest continuum and lattice models, partly because such entropies depend nontrivially on all geometric characteristics of the entangling region. Quantum information measures between two or more regions are even more complicated, but contain more, and universal, information. In this paper, we focus on R{\'e}nyi entropy and information of the order n ââ=ââ2. For a free field theory, we show that these quantities are mapped to the change of the thermodynamic free energy by introducing boundaries subject to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in one higher dimension. This mapping allows us to exploit the powerful tools available in the context of thermal Casimir effect, specifically a multipole expansion suited for computing the R{\'e}nyi information between arbitrarily-shaped regions. In particular, we compute the R{\'e}nyi information between two disk-shaped regions at an arbitrary separation distance. We provide an alternative representation of the R{\'e}nyi information as a sum over closed-loop polymers, which establishes a connection to purely entropic effects, and proves useful in deriving information inequalities. Finally, we discuss extensions of our results beyond free field theories.},

	Abstract = {We perform an analytical study of the energy and entanglement spectrum of non-interacting fermionic bilayer honeycomb lattices in the presence of trigonal warping in the energy spectrum, on-site energy difference and uniform magnetic field. Employing single particle correlation functions, we present an explicit form for a layer--layer entanglement Hamiltonian whose spectrum is the entanglement spectrum. We demonstrate that in the absence of trigonal warping, at zero on-site energy difference exact correspondence is established between the entanglement spectrum and energy spectrum of a monolayer which means that the entanglement spectrum perfectly reflects the edge state properties of the bilayer. We also show that trigonal warping breaks down such a perfect correspondence, however, in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2016/11/113101/jstataa462dieqn001.gif] {$ \Gamma $} -K direction in the hexagonal Brillouin zone, their behaviors are remarkably the same for particular relevances of hopping parameters. In the presence of an on-site energy difference the symmetry of the entanglement spectrum is broken with opening an indirect entanglement gap. We also study the effects of a perpendicular magnetic field on both energy and the entanglement spectrum of the bilayer in the presence of trigonal warping and on-site energy difference. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum versus magnetic flux has a self similar fractal structure, known as the Hofstadter butterfly. Our results also show that the on-site energy difference causes a transition from the Hofstadter butterfly to a tree-like picture.},

@article{1367-2630-18-12-123035,
	Abstract = {Recent years have seen an enormously revived interest in the study of thermodynamic notions in the quantum regime. This applies both to the study of notions of work extraction in thermal machines in the quantum regime, as well as to questions of equilibration and thermalisation of interacting quantum many-body systems as such. In this work we bring together these two lines of research by studying work extraction in a closed system that undergoes a sequence of quenches and equilibration steps concomitant with free evolutions. In this way, we incorporate an important insight from the study of the dynamics of quantum many body systems: the evolution of closed systems is expected to be well described, for relevant observables and most times, by a suitable equilibrium state. We will consider three kinds of equilibration, namely to (i) the time averaged state, (ii) the Gibbs ensemble and (iii) the generalised Gibbs ensemble, reflecting further constants of motion in integrable models. For each effective description, we investigate notions of entropy production, the validity of the minimal work principle and properties of optimal work extraction protocols. While we keep the discussion general, much room is dedicated to the discussion of paradigmatic non-interacting fermionic quantum many-body systems, for which we identify significant differences with respect to the role of the minimal work principle. Our work not only has implications for experiments with cold atoms, but also can be viewed as suggesting a mindset for quantum thermodynamics where the role of the external heat baths is instead played by the system itself, with its internal degrees of freedom bringing coarse-grained observables to equilibrium.},

	Abstract = {We consider the logarithmic negativity of a finite interval embedded in an infinite one dimensional system at finite temperature. We focus on conformal invariant systems and we show that the naive approach based on the calculation of a two-point function of twist fields in a cylindrical geometry yields a wrong result. The correct result is obtained through a four-point function of twist fields in which two auxiliary fields are inserted far away from the interval, and they are sent to infinity only after having taken the replica limit. In this way, we find a universal scaling form for the finite temperature negativity which depends on the full operator content of the theory and not only on the central charge. In the limit of low and high temperatures, the expansion of this universal form can be obtained by means of the operator product expansion. We check our results against exact numerical computations for the critical harmonic chain.},

The asymptotically exact mutual information for a partition of the 1D lattice satisfies an area law, with a prefactor which we compute explicitly. As examples, we discuss the fermionic XX model in one dimension and free fermionic models on the torus in higher dimensions in detail. Special emphasis is put on the discussion of the temperature dependence of the mutual information, scaling like the logarithm of the inverse temperature, hence confirming an expression suggested by conformal field theory. We also comment on the applicability of the formalism to treat open systems driven by quantum noise. In the appendix, we derive useful bounds to the mutual information in terms of purities. Finally, we provide a detailed error analysis for finite system sizes. This analysis is valuable in its own right for the abstract theory of T{\"o}plitz determinants.},

	Abstract = {The entanglement entropy of a noninteracting fermionic system confined to a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice on a torus is calculated. We find that the entanglement entropy can characterize Lifshitz phase transitions without a local order parameter. In the noncritical phase and critical phase with a nodal Fermi surface, the entanglement entropy satisfies an area law. The leading subarea term is a constant in the gapped phase rather than a logarithmic additive term in the gapless regime. The tuning of chemical potential allows for a nonzero Fermi surface, whose variation along a particular direction determines a logarithmic violation of the area law. We perform the scaling of entanglement entropy numerically and find agreement between the analytic and numerical results. Furthermore, we clearly show that an entanglement spectrum is equivalent to an edge spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Shannon--R{\'e}nyi entropies and associated participation spectra quantify how much a many-body wave-function is localized in a given configuration basis. Using these tools, we present an analysis of the ground-state wave functions of various quantum spin systems in one and two dimensions. General ideas and a review of the current status of this field are first given, with a particular emphasis on universal subleading terms characterizing different quantum phases of matter, and associated transitions. We highlight the connection with the related entanglement entropies and spectra when this is possible. In a second part, new results are presented for the participation spectra of interacting spin models, mostly based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations, but also using perturbation theory in some cases. For full antiferromagnetic one-dimensional systems, participation spectra are analyzed in terms of ferromagnetic domain walls which experience a pairwise attractive interaction. This confinement potential is either linear for long-range N{\'e}el order, or logarithmic for quasi-long-range order. The case of subsystems is also analyzed in great detail for a 2d dimerized Heisenberg model undergoing a quantum phase transition between a gapped paramagnet and a N{\'e}el phase. Participation spectra of line shaped (1d) sub-systems are quantitatively compared with finite temperature participation spectra of ansatz effective boundary (1d) entanglement Hamiltonians. While short-range models describe almost perfectly the gapped side, the N{\'e}el regime is best compared using long-range effective Hamiltonians. Spectral comparisons performed using Kullback--Leibler divergences, a tool potentially useful for entanglement spectra, provide a quantitative way to identify both the best boundary entanglement Hamiltonian and effective temperature.},

	Abstract = {We consider Anderson localization and the associated metal--insulator transition for non-interacting fermions in D = 1, 2 space dimensions in the presence of spatially correlated on-site random potentials. To assess the nature of the wave function, we follow a recent proposal to study momentum-space entanglement. For a D = 1 model with long-range disorder correlations, both the entanglement spectrum and the entanglement entropy allow us to clearly distinguish between extended and localized states based upon a single realization of disorder. However, for other models, including the D = 2 case with long-range correlated disorder, we find that the method is not similarly successful. We analyze the reasons for its failure, concluding that the much desired generalization to higher dimensions may be problematic.},

In the non-interacting case the Hamiltonian matrix is tridiagonal and the eigenvalues and vectors can be given explicitly as a function of a single parameter which is known analytically for odd chain lengths and can be determined numerically in the even length case. From a scaling analysis of these data for essentially semi-infinite chains we obtain the fidelity susceptibility and show that it contains a boundary contribution which is different in the topologically ordered than in the topologically trivial phase. For the entanglement spectrum and entropy we confirm predictions from massive field theory for a block in the middle of an infinite chain but also consider blocks containing the edge of the chain. For the latter case we show that in the SPT phase additional entanglement---as compared to the trivial phase---is present which is localized at the boundary. Finally, we extend our study to the dimerized chain with a nearest-neighbour interaction using exact diagonalization, Arnoldi and density-matrix renormalization group methods and show that a phase transition into a topologically trivial charge-density wave phase occurs.},

The entanglement entropy in this model separates into a contribution from a Z 2 gauge field and that of a system of hopping Majorana fermions, similar to what occurs in the Kitaev model. This separation enables the systematic study of the entanglement of this 3D interacting bosonic model by using the tools of non-interacting fermions. In this way, we find that the topological entanglement entropy comes exclusively from the Z 2 gauge field and that it is the same for all of the phases of the system. There are differences, however, in the entanglement spectrum of the Majorana fermions that distinguish between the topologically distinct phases of the model. We further point out that the effect of introducing vortex lines in the Z 2 gauge field will only change the entanglement contribution of the Majorana fermions. We evaluate this contribution to the entanglement which arises due to gapless Majorana modes that are trapped by the vortex lines.},

We further verify that the entanglement spectrum corresponding to a real space partitioning contains C chiral modes and thereby complies with the archetypal correspondence between the bulk entanglement and the edge energetics. Finally, we address the issue of interactions and study the problem of two interacting particles projected to the flattened band as a function of the Chern number.

The entanglement contour provides a complementary, more refined approach to characterizing entanglement than just considering the entanglement entropy between A and B , with several concrete advantages. We illustrate this in the context of ground states and quantum quenches in fermionic quadratic systems. For instance, in a quantum critical system in D = 1 spatial dimensions, the entanglement contour allows us to determine the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory from just a single partition of the system into regions A and B (using the entanglement entropy for the same task requires considering several partitions). In D â©¾ 2 dimensions, the entanglement contour can distinguish between gapped and gapless phases that obey the same boundary law for entanglement entropy. During a local or global quantum quench, the time-dependent contour provides a detailed account of the dynamics of entanglement, including propagating entanglement waves, which offers a microscopic explanation of the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of time.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the entanglement entropy properties of a 2D p-wave superconductor with Rashba spin--orbit coupling, which displays a rich phase-space that supports non-trivial topological phases, as the chemical potential and the Zeeman term are varied. We show that the entanglement entropy and its derivatives clearly signal the topological transitions and we find numerical evidence that for this model the derivative with respect to the magnetization provides a sensible signature of each topological phase. Following the area law for the entanglement entropy, we systematically analyze the contributions that are proportional to or independent of the perimeter of the system, as a function of the Hamiltonian coupling constants and the geometry of the finite subsystem. For this model, we show that even though the topological entanglement entropy vanishes, it signals the topological phase transitions in a finite system. We also observe a relationship between a topological contribution to the entanglement entropy in a half-cylinder geometry and the number of edge states, and that the entanglement spectrum has robust modes associated with each edge state, as in other topological systems.},

	Abstract = {We study the spectrum of the Toeplitz matrix with a sine kernel, which corresponds to the single-particle reduced density matrix for free fermions on the one-dimensional lattice. For the spectral determinant of this matrix, a Fisher--Hartwig expansion in the inverse matrix size has been recently conjectured. This expansion can be verified order by order, away from the line of accumulation of zeros, using the recurrence relation known from the theory of discrete Painlev{\'e} equations. We perform such a verification to the tenth order and calculate the corresponding coefficients in the Fisher--Hartwig expansion. Under the assumption of the validity of the Fisher--Hartwig expansion in the whole range of the spectral parameter, we further derive expansions for an equation on the eigenvalues of this matrix and for the von Neumann entanglement entropy in the corresponding fermion problem. These analytical results are supported by a numerical example.},

The dynamics is obtained by means of the adaptive time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group. We show that the entanglement entropies (von Neumann and R{\'e}nyi) in the presence of a weakened bond depend on the sign of the bulk interaction. For an attractive interaction (Î < 0), the defect turns out to be irrelevant and the evolution is asymptotically equivalent to the one without defect obtained by conformal field theory. For a repulsive interaction (Î > 0), the defect is relevant and the entanglement saturates to a finite value. This out-of-equilibrium behavior generalizes the well-known results for the ground-state entanglement entropy of the model.},

	Abstract = {Numerical studies of the reduced density matrix of a gapped spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a two-leg ladder find that it has the same form as the Gibbs density matrix of a gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain at a finite temperature determined by the spin gap of the ladder. We investigate this interesting result by considering a model of free fermions on a two-leg ladder (gapped by the inter-chain tunneling operator) and in spin systems on a ladder with a gapped ground state using exact solutions and several controlled approximations. We calculate the reduced density matrix and the entanglement entropy for a leg of the ladder (i.e. a cut made between the chains). In the fermionic system we find the exact form of the reduced density matrix for one of the chains and determine the entanglement spectrum explicitly. Here we find that in the weak tunneling limit of the ladder the entanglement entropy of one chain of the gapped ladder has a simple and universal form dictated by conformal invariance. In the case of the spin system, we consider the strong coupling limit by using perturbation theory and get the reduced density matrix by the Schmidt decomposition. The entanglement entropies of a general gapped system of two coupled conformal field theories (in 1 + 1 dimensions) are discussed using the replica trick and scaling arguments. We show that (1) for a system with a bulk gap the reduced density matrix has the form of a thermal density matrix, (2) the long-wavelength modes of one subsystem (a chain) of a gapped coupled system are always thermal, (3) the von Neumann entropy equals the thermodynamic entropy of one chain, and (4) the bulk gap plays the role of effective temperature.},

We then apply this method to conformally invariant field theories (CFTs) in several different physical situations for infinite and finite systems and without or with boundaries. In particular, in the case of two adjacent intervals of lengths â 1 ,â 2 in an infinite system, we derive the result â° â¼ ( c /4)ln(â 1 â 2 /(â 1 + â 2 )), where c is the central charge. For the more complicated case of two disjoint intervals, we show that the negativity depends only on the harmonic ratio of the four end points and so is manifestly scale invariant. We explicitly calculate the scale invariant functions for the replicated traces in the case of the CFT for the free compactified boson, but we have not so far been able to obtain the n â 1 continuation for the negativity even in the limit of large compactification radius. We have checked all our findings against exact numerical results for the harmonic chain which is described by a non-compactified free boson.},

By using dimerized chains as an example, it is demonstrated that the evolution of OPES for the quenched bipartite systems is governed by an effective Hamiltonian which is characterized by a pseudospin in a time-dependent pseudomagnetic field S ( k , t ). The existence and evolution of the topological maximally entangled states (tMESs) are determined by the winding number of S ( k , t ) in the k -space. In particular, the tMESs survive only if nontrivial Berry phases are induced by the winding of S ( k , t ). In the infinite-time limit the equilibrium OPES can be determined by an effective time-independent pseudomagnetic field S eff ( k ). Furthermore, when tMESs are unstable, they are destroyed by quasiparticles within a characteristic timescale in proportion to the system size.},

At Î =â 1 (ferromagnetic point) the model is equivalent to the Heisenberg ferromagnet and its degenerate ground state manifold is the S U (2) multiplet with maximal total spin.

In the gapless phase at Î >â 1 this property is progressively lost as one moves away from the Î =â 1 point. We investigate how the ES obtained from the states in this manifold reflects this change, using exact diagonalization and Bethe ansatz calculations. We find that in the limit Î â â1 + most of the ES levels show divergent behavior. Moreover, while at Î =â 1 the ES contains no information about the boundaries, for Î >â 1 it depends dramatically on the choice of boundary conditions. For both open and periodic boundary conditions the ES exhibits an elegant multiplicity structure for which we conjecture a combinatorial formula. We also study the entanglement eigenfunctions, i.e. the eigenfunctions of the reduced density matrix. We find that the eigenfunctions corresponding to the non-diverging levels mimic the behavior of the state wavefunction, whereas the others show intriguing polynomial structures.

We study this phenomenon using simple models, which also illustrate the relationship between the entanglement spectrum of the initial state and the generalized Gibbs ensemble describing the long-time correlations after the quench. We also show that the effective temperature characterizing the correlations is not related to the energy fluctuations after the quench, and therefore does not have thermodynamic meaning. The latter observation implies a breakdown of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem.},

	Abstract = {The concept of spin--orbital entanglement on superexchange bonds in transition metal oxides is introduced and explained on several examples. It is shown that spin--orbital entanglement in superexchange models destabilizes the long-range (spin and orbital) order and may lead either to a disordered spin-liquid state or to novel phases at low temperature which arise from strongly frustrated interactions. Such novel ground states cannot be described within the conventionally used mean field theory which separates spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Even in cases where the ground states are disentangled, spin--orbital entanglement occurs in excited states and may become crucial for a correct description of physical properties at finite temperature. As an important example of this behaviour we present spin--orbital entanglement in the RV O 3 perovskites, with R = La,Pr,{\ldots},Y b,Lu, where the finite temperature properties of these compounds can be understood only using entangled states: (i) the thermal evolution of the optical spectral weights, (ii) the dependence of the transition temperatures for the onset of orbital and magnetic order on the ionic radius in the phase diagram of the RV O 3 perovskites, and (iii) the dimerization observed in the magnon spectra for the C-type antiferromagnetic phase of Y V O 3 . Finally, it is shown that joint spin--orbital excitations in an ordered phase with coexisting antiferromagnetic and alternating orbital order introduce topological constraints for the hole propagation and will thus radically modify the transport properties in doped Mott insulators where hole motion implies simultaneous spin and orbital excitations.},

	Abstract = {The entanglement quantum properties of a spin-1/2 Ising--Heisenberg model on a symmetrical diamond chain were analyzed. Due to the separable nature of the Ising-type exchange interactions between neighboring Heisenberg dimers, calculation of the entanglement can be performed exactly for each individual dimer. Pairwise thermal entanglement was studied in terms of the isotropic Ising--Heisenberg model and analytical expressions for the concurrence (as a measure of bipartite entanglement) were obtained. The effects of external magnetic field H and next-nearest neighbor interaction J m between nodal Ising sites were considered. The ground state structure and entanglement properties of the system were studied in a wide range of coupling constant values. Various regimes with different values of ground state entanglement were revealed, depending on the relation between competing interaction strengths. Finally, some novel effects, such as the two-peak behavior of concurrence versus temperature and coexistence of phases with different values of magnetic entanglement, were observed.},

The concurrence in terms of the three-qubit isotropic Heisenberg model in an effective Ising field is non-zero even in the absence of a magnetic field. The magnetic and entanglement properties exhibit common plateau and peak features observable via the (antiferromagnetic) coupling constant and external magnetic field.

We derive universal formulas for the leading behavior and for subleading corrections to the scaling. The universality of the results allows us to make predictions for the finite size scaling forms of the corrections to the scaling.},

The disorder-averaged entanglement entropy provides insight into the quantum criticality of these systems and an understanding of their relationship to non-random ('pure') quantum criticality. The entanglement near many such critical points in one dimension shows a logarithmic divergence in subsystem size, similar to that in the pure case but with a different universal coefficient. Such universal coefficients are examples of universal critical amplitudes in a random system. Possible measurements are reviewed along with the one-particle entanglement scaling at certain Anderson localization transitions.

Our focus is mainly on impurity entanglement as it occurs in one-dimensional systems with a single impurity or a boundary, in particular quantum spin models, but generalizations to higher dimensions are also reviewed. Recent advances in the understanding of impurity entanglement as it occurs in the spin-boson and Kondo impurity models are discussed along with the influence of boundaries. Particular attention is paid to (1 + 1)-dimensional models where analytical results can be obtained for the case of conformally invariant boundary conditions and a connection to topological entanglement entropy is made. New results for the entanglement in systems with mixed boundary conditions are presented. Analytical results for the entanglement entropy obtained from Fermi liquid theory are also discussed as well as several different recent definitions of the impurity contribution to the entanglement entropy.},

	Abstract = {The analysis of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem of a one-dimensional quantum system is a powerful tool for unravelling its critical nature. For instance, the scaling behaviour of the entanglement entropy determines the central charge of the associated Virasoro algebra. For a free fermion system, the entanglement entropy depends essentially on two sets, namely the set A of sites of the subsystem considered and the set K of excited momentum modes. In this work we make use of a general duality principle establishing the invariance of the entanglement entropy under exchange of the sets A and K to tackle complex problems by studying their dual counterparts. The duality principle is also a key ingredient in the formulation of a novel conjecture for the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement entropy of a free fermion system in the general case in which both sets A and K consist of an arbitrary number of blocks. We have verified that this conjecture reproduces the numerical results with excellent precision for all the configurations analyzed. We have also applied the conjecture to deduce several asymptotic formulas for the mutual and r-partite information generalizing the known ones for the single block case.},

In the Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid regime, we calculate the second R{\'e}nyi entanglement entropy and show that the leading order finite-size scaling is equal to a universal logarithm of the system size plus a non-universal constant. Higher-order corrections decay as power-laws in the system size with exponents that depend only on the Luttinger parameter. We confirm the universality of our results by investigating the one dimensional ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2017/8/083108/jstataa819aieqn001.gif] {$t-V$} model of interacting spinless fermions via exact-diagonalization techniques.
