To my educators, for teaching me what I know today. To my incredible family for their never ending support. To my advisor, Adrian Del Maestro, for guiding my path as a graduate student and making the journey so enjoyable. And to Hatem Barghathi, for the countless hours spent teaching me about most of the topics that will be presented in this thesis and many more outside its scope.
