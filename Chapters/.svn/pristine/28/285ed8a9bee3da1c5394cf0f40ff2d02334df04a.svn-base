Fermionic Particle Entanglement

	Introduction Random Thoughts
		- Norm's paper on the quantum gas microscope provides a method to reconstruct
		  1d fermionic wave functions from cold atom experiments
		- talk about fluctuation measures (for fermions a la Florencie)
			. here the Luttinger parameter always shows up in the leading order term
			. they also discuss the XXZ model explicitely in 
			. Song, H. F., Rachel, S. & Le Hur, K. Phys. Rev. B 82, 012405 (2010).
			. Song, H. F., Rachel, S., Flindt, C., Klich, I., Laflorencie, N. & Le Hur, K.  
			  Phys. Rev. B 85, 035409 (2012).
		- Spatial entanglement in the XXZ model
			. Laflorencie, N. & Rachel, S.  J. Stat. Mech.: Theor. Exp. 2014, P11013 (2014). 
		- probably need to disucss issues with indistinguishable particles
			. Ghirardi and Marianatto
			. Tichy, Mintert
			. Balachandran et al.
		- particle entanglement cannot be used as a resource
			. Ghirardi and Marinatto
		- Need ED for fermions and particle entanglement
		- For indistinguishable particles, PE can arise from exchange statistics alone
		- Much debate about what the appropriate measure of entanglement for indistingushable
		  particles (see 73-77 of PRE)
		- PE vanish when the many-body state is in a product state in first quantized notation
		- when all particles are condnesed into a single mode
		- thus many-fermion systems always have non-zero PE
		- PE arises from both interactions and statistics
		- difference between bosons and fermions
		- leading order scaling of the PE is not sensitive to boundary conditions 
		  (as in the case of spatial entanglement).
			. Calabrese and Cardy J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42, 504005 (2009)
		- sensitive to exclusion statistics and anyon statistics
		- general bounds proposed by Haque et al.
			. upper bounds are not saturated
		- point out that while there is a BA solution to XXZ, getting correlation functions
		  (and thus entanglements) is highly non-trivial
		- Haque paper "set the framework for studies of PE in interacting lattice models"
		- particle partitions are only well defined for itinerant systems
		- particularly useful when the wavefunctions are known in first quantization
		- states that are more "non-trivially correlated" have stronger n-dependence of 
		  Î±_n
		- for bose systems, PE is only non-zero when their are interactions, it can be 
		  thought of as measuring the de-population of the condensate
		- fermions saturate the lower bound when when the wavefunction is a single
		  Slater determinant
		- ground state of hard core bosons with V = -2 known exactly
			. Yang C N and Yang C P 1966 Phys. Rev. 151 258
		- need to clearly distinguish our paper from Haque et al.
			. larger system sizes, numerically confirming predicted scaling form
		- Entanglement appearing amongst identical particles can be extracted into an 
		  entangled state of independent modes
			. Killoran, N., Cramer, M. & Plenio, M. B.  Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 150501 (2014).
			. symmetrization entanglement is a fundamental, ubiquitous, and readily 
			  extractable resource for standard quantum information tasks.
		- The true indistinguishablity of particles is a hallmark of quantum mechanics.
		- Subsystems cannot be operationally distinguished for identical particles
		- Concurrence is known to be maximized at 1/2 filling for an infinite lattice
			. Zanardi, P. & Wang, X.  J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35, 7947 (2002).
		- Generalized entanglament (Viola et al)
			. Identical quantum particles must lie in the proper (symmetric or antisymmetric)
			  subspace of the respective tensor products of observable spaces making the 
			  identification of local subsystems more difficult.
		- What modes do you choose? Spatial? Momentum?
		- There are no local opeartions that act only on a subgroup of indentical particles
		- Entanglement properties thus depend on the single particle basis used
		- For single particles, local unitary transformations do not change the entanglement
		- Entanglement depends on the choice of single particle basis
		- modes are distinguishable
		- no tensor product structure for identical particles due to (anti)symmetrization
		- This is an instance of a superselection rule, -> limitation on the possibility of 
		  preparing a given state.
		- entanglement relativity
			. Definition of entanglement relies on the tensor-product structure of a composite 
			  quantum system
			. Zanardi, P. Phys. Rev. A 65, 042101 (2002).
		- entanglement crucially depends on the choice of a particular partition into physical
		  subsystems
		- classical objects have an inexhaustable set of attributes and are thus always
		  distinguishable
		- subadditivity: pair of correlated systems involves more information than the two
		  systems considered separately
		- Fermionic Entanglement (itinerant)
			. McMinis and Tubman; Swingle and : Renyi EE for the interacting Fermi liquid
			. Swingle (fermi surface)

			. Grover
			. Lundgren (momentum space)
			. Ding and Yang (bosonization)
	

	Luttinger Liquid Calculation
		- Dzyaloshinskii-Larkin solution is only valid for spinless fermions due to 
		  neglect of backscattering across the fermi surface
		- Is g limited in the LL theory to repulsive interactions? 
			. I don't think so as we can have all values of K, need to check this.
